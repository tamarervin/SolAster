# About the Project

This package provides the necessary querying, analysis, and calculation
methods to independently derive 'sun-as-a-star' RV variations using SDO/HMI 
data for any time span since SDO has begun observing. 

Scaling factors are provided in order to calculate RVs comparable to magnitudes
measured by ground-based spectrographs (HARPS-N and NEID). In addition, there
are routines to calculate magnetic observables to compare with RV variations and
determine what is driving Solar activity.

A huge thank you to RaphaÃ«lle Haywood for her guidance and support on this
project and for her papers that outlined the methodology of calculation.
